# Next Steps
* Create python script that
 1. Gives me my ip address
 2. python local_sockets
  * Should open up a web interface showing everyone who ran the local sockets program. This pg can just list ip's
      ALGORITHM
       1. This connects to my website which manages the local ip interface.

What needs to work for first iteration:
1. Go to local address at port #
2. Choose to upload a file
3. Someone can visit your local ip at your port and choose to download your file
